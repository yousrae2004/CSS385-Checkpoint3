# Checkpoint3: Game Test Summary

For my game, A Cat's Quest, I had five different questions I asked three game testers below. My findings resulted in a similar result, which can be found in the summary section.

## 5 Questions for Game Testers
**1. What vibe does the game give off?**

**2. Was the environment easy to navigate?**

**3. Did you ever feel stuck or unsure of where to go next?**

**4. Did the dialogue with the Owner feel natural? Was the text easy to read, and did you understand your goal after the conversation?**

**5. What are some suggestions on how to complete the game?**

## Summary of Findings/Common Patterns
The vibe of the game conveys what it was originally supposed to be with the sounds, background music, and art. All the testers described it as either cute or cozy, and the last tester compared it to Minecraft, with a similar game to relax and kill time. The main issue present throughout the testers' feedback was mainly regarding objectives and how they could be clearer, especially for beginners. Sometimes, they were unsure how to continue, but the overall navigation was simple enough. Some examples of objective suggestions included a door that was more visible, or potentially arrows pointing where to go next, like a tutorial, or having a reminder, such as including a pop-up with "hold E to interact" similar to Roblox games. This can serve as a pointer to certain objects and highlight which ones _can_ be interacted with. When it came to suggestions for expanding the game, testers suggested interactions with NPC characters, like a cat companion, another house owner to assist, or maybe an enemy, like a dog. Additionally, generally adding more content and side quests can add more to the game's objective.
